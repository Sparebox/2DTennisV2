# 2DTennisV2

A freetime project to make a better version of an earlier tennis game called 2DTennis. This time with the JBox2D physics library implemented. This version includes the new versus mode where you can play against the computer and CPU mode where the computer plays for you.
The Windows platform is the only one supported right now

## How To Launch
Download the `2DTennisV2Build.zip` from releases, extract it and run the `launch.bat` script

## How To Play
See the controls in the Tutorial view from the main menu. In Settings you can change the target FPS. You can change the tile rows if you have the CPU game mode selected. By pressing the Next button in settings you can choose the game mode between SINGLE, CPU and VERSUS. SINGLE is the default game mode where you try to clear all the tiles to win the game. CPU is like a spectator mode where you can see the computer do its best to win the game for you. VERSUS means that you challange the computer to duel! The computer controls a racquet on the top and you on the bottom. Try to win by getting the ball past the upper racquet.

You can always exit a game by pressing ESCAPE any time
